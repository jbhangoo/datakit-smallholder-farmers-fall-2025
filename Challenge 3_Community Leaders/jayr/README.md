November 5th - December 5th, 2025

## Challenge 3: Identifying Community Leaders

Progress is being logged in the Jupyter notebook `network.ipynb`

Two approaches

1. Create a graph of the network and use network analysis to identify the key nodes
2. Evaluate statistical metrics of the data and correlation coefficients between users

## Details

Goal: Discover “leader” farmers who consistently provide valuable support to others.

Context: Some users may be highly active, answering many questions or providing particularly high-quality answers. Identifying them could help Producers Direct to better learn how to identify these farmers going forward and ultimately build trust in digital advisory services.  

Guiding Questions:
Who are the most active and most trusted contributors?
Are there patterns in how leaders interact - e.g., topics they specialize in or regions they serve?
Are there other patterns - e.g. are farmers asking the same or similar questions over and over again? (this can indicate challenges around trust)
What traits define a “community leader”?

Suggested Outputs:
Network visualizations showing relationships between question askers and answerers
A leaderboard or ranking of top contributors with metrics (e.g., #answers, avg. rating)
A brief analysis of what makes these users stand out
